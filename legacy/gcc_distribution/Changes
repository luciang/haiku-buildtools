User relevant changes from version 041202 to 060710:

binutils:
	- ld is no longer patched to not allow undefined symbols in
	  objects, as this is now done via gcc-specs.
	- ld is no longer patched to not use relocation combination (combreloc),
	  as the default (using it) seems to generate slightly smaller results and
	  does not break anything (apparently).

gcc:
	- added missing documentation for --relative-path-errors option.
	- added --no-undefined to the specs so that we can drop a patch that changed
	  ld to use this as default.
	- provide convenience fixed(ios&) and scientific(ios&) inline functions
	- fixed scientific(ios& i) (thanks to John [Beta] Drinkwater)
	- Applied several (old, external) patches that enable the support for anonymous
	  structs and unions in C as well as in C++ (application of this patch has
	  been sugggested by execom through BeBits-talkback).
