Notes for OpenSSH 4.7p1 (Haiku r24683)
======================================

configure
---------

  rm config.sub config.guess
  automake --add-missing
  autoreconf --force

  ./configure --prefix=/boot/home/config --with-ssl-dir=/boot/home/config

* automake will fail, but it will replace config.{sub,guess} anyway, which is
  all we want.
* Edit config.h:
  - Undefined HAVE_CONTROL_IN_MSGHDR: Haiku doesn't really support it.
  - define HAVE_U_INT64_T: Only to get rid of warnings while compiling. The
    configure test only includes <sys/types.h>, which doesn't define Haiku's
    u_int64_t (<stdint.h> does).

make/install
------------

  make
  make install
